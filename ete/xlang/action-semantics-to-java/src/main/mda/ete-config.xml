        A project is a set of pipelines, each pipeline is made of "steps".
        Each step receives a model and returns a model.
        Some steps accept null as the entry model, for example, steps reading
        a model.
        Some steps return the model they receive but produce some board effects,
        for example "dump" steps, "template" steps or "register" steps.
